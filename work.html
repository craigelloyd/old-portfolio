<p>I'm the Director of Content Operations at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com">iFixit</a>, overseeing the behind-the-scenes efforts of our editorial, video, and technical writing teams.</p>

<p>Before I joined iFixit, I was a content writer for over ten years, mainly focusing on technology-related topics. And I have experience in a number of fields, including copy editing, podcasting, marketing, and photography.</p>

<h2>Technical Writing/Service Documentation</h2>

<p>Before I was the director of content ops at iFixit, I was a technical writer and created all sorts of repair documentation for products ranging from consumer electronics to outdoor power equipment. Here are some samples:</p>

<h2>Content Writing</h2>

<p>I've written thousands of articles over the years, but I can't possibly fit them all on this page. So here are a handful that I'm particularly fond of:</p>

<h2>Other Things</h2>

<h3>Media Appearances</h3>

<p>I was <a href="https://www.t-online.de/digital/handy/id_86143270/so-retten-sie-ihr-smartphone-bei-wasserschaden.html">quoted by T-Online</a> (one of Germany's largest news sites) about the illusion of waterproof smartphones and what you can do if yours took a dunk.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM-6oi6FSyU">two</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/nV11hiitIFE">appearances</a> on CBC Radio discussing Apple's software limitation on third-party (and even OEM) iPhone battery replacements, as well as the "Batterygate" controversy from 2017.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/when-to-replace-laptop-battery/">quoted in a PopSci article</a> about when you should replace the battery in your laptop.

<h3>Podcasting</h3>

<p>I directed, co-hosted, and edited eight episodes of <a href="http://repairradio.buzzsprout.com/">Repair Radio</a>, iFixit's official podcast.</p>

<h3>Photography</h3>

<p>My photography skills get put to good use on the job, but I also enjoy dabbling in it <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cra1gll0yd/">every now and then for fun</a>, and I was lucky enough to have one of my photos published in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ticket-Ride-Essential-Greatest-Coasters/dp/0785835776/">book about roller coasters and thrill rides</a>.</p>

<h3>Video Appearances</h3>

<h3>Coding/Programming</h3>

<p>I know a bit of HTML and CSS (I made this website from scratch, with some help from Google and <em>a lot</em> of trial and error), and I love tinkering around with Google Apps Script, spreadsheet formulas, and SQL.</p>
