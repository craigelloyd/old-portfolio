<p>This page is about me, personally, as well as my history writing professionally. To view my portfolio, head <a href="https://www.craigelloyd.com/portfolio/work">here</a>.</p>

<img src="sup.jpg" alt="My self portrait" class="responsive" style="width:500px;margin-top:-15px">

<p>Born and raised in Indiana, I spent most of my youth living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebury,_Indiana">Middlebury</a>. It's a small town of a few thousand people, about a three-hour drive east from Chicago. I was a competitive swimmer for ten years, spending four of those years on the high school swim team, winning the conference championship all four years.</p>

<p>I earned my Bachelor of Science in Media and Public Communication from <a href="https://www.pfw.edu/">Purdue University Fort Wayne</a>, with a minor in Media Production. I spent three years writing and editing for the student newspaper, <em>The Communicator</em>. While there, I earned a spot as an <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/awards/2011-online-pacemaker-winners/">Online Pacemaker Award finalist</a> from the Associated Collegiate Press. During my senior year, I worked as a marketing intern for local non-profit <a href="http://artsunited.org/">Arts United</a>, where I spearheaded the weekly newsletter and assisted with event organization.</p>

<p>After graduating in 2012, I spent four months as an editorial intern at <a href="https://lifehacker.com/"><em>Lifehacker</em></a> where I wrote numerous articles covering technology, lifestyle, and DIY topics, many of which have received hundreds of thousands of views. I was also responsible for the daily news roundup series <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tag/remains-of-the-day"><em>Remains of the Day</em></a>.</p>

<p>Following my stint as a <em>Lifehacker</em> intern, I spent around seven years writing thousands of articles for various online technology publications, including <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/"><em>SlashGear</em></a>, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gottabemobile.com/"><em>GottaBeMobile</em></a>, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/"><em>How-To Geek</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/"><em>Review Geek</em></a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I moved to California where I work full-time at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com">iFixit</a>, starting off as an editorial writer, and transitioning to technical writing. I'm now the Director of Content Operations, overseeing the day-to-day and behind-the-scenes operations of the editorial, video, and technical writing teams.</p>

<p>I love getting my hands dirty with DIY projects around the house and in the garage, and I get a bit antsy if I go a few days without picking up a tool. I enjoy riding motorcycles, hiking, and sightseeing, but I also enjoy spending just as much time indoors, hanging out with my wonderful wife, Kim, and our two cats, Opal and Olive.</p>
